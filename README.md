# Enumerables Test

This is just a solution/project to mess around with creating some classes that implement `IEnumerable` and `IEnumerator`. Mostly just done so I can learn more about how they work.

All examples in here are very contrived and obviously not real-world examples of when to use them.

The PokeAPI stuff is commented out to avoid hitting the API too much. Can be uncommented to test how that class works.
